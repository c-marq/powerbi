Possible questions for this dataset from a STEM-focused test-prep company,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which states have total SAT scores that are below the Mean? Median? How about for ACT composite?,,,,,,,,,,,,
In which states do the majority of students take the SAT? How about the ACT?,,,,,,,,,,,,
What are the bottom 10 states when it comes to SAT math? ACT math? ACT science?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tough: Which states are in the top 10 for total SAT scores, yet in the bottom 10 for participation? How about for the ACT composite?",,,,,,,,,,,,
